# Mobile Price Classification Model

This repository contains a Mobile Price Classification Model aimed at predicting the price range of mobile phones based on their technical specifications. The goal is to classify mobile phones into one of four price ranges using machine learning techniques.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project comes from [Kaggle's Mobile Price Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iabhishekofficial/mobile-price-classification/data). It includes the following features:

Each mobile phone in the dataset is labeled with one of four price ranges (0 to 3), with 0 being the cheapest and 3 being the most expensive.

## Usage
To run the notebook locally, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- 'pandas'
- 'numpy'
- 'scikit-learn'
- 'matplotlib'
- 'seaborn'

## Evaluation
The model is evaluated using various metrics, including:

Accuracy: The percentage of correct classifications.

Confusion Matrix: Breakdown of true vs. false predictions across price categories.

Precision & Recall: Measures of the modelâ€™s ability to correctly identify price categories.

Initial results show promising accuracy, and additional fine-tuning may lead to even better performance.
